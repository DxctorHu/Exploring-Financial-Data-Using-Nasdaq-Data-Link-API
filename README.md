# Exploring-Financial-Data-Using-Nasdaq-Data-Link-API

I cleaned financial datasets with pandas, analyzed stock trends, created visualizations with Matplotlib, and developed a linear regression model using time and expense turnover to predict a financial metric. This enhanced my skills in financial data analysis.
