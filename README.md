# Exploring-Financial-Data-Using-Nasdaq-Data-Link-API
In this data science project, I analyzed real-world economic data to uncover market trends using Python and the Nasdaq Data Link API. I retrieved financial datasets, including stock prices and economic indicators, and applied data wrangling techniques with pandas to clean and structure the data. I analyzed stock price trends, calculated key financial statistics such as returns and moving averages, and created visualizations using Matplotlib to illustrate relationships between various financial metrics. Additionally, I developed a linear regression model using time and accrued expense turnover as variables to predict a financial metric. This project provided hands-on experience in working with financial APIs, analyzing market data, and applying statistical modeling techniques, all valuable skills for data-driven finance roles.
